  "body": "Hello Support Team,\n\nI have been unable to log into my online banking account for the past 2 days. I keep getting an \"Invalid credentials\" error even though I'm certain my password is correct.\n\nAccount Number: ACC-2020-6655\nUsername: lisathompson88\n\nI tried the \"Forgot Password\" option but I'm not receiving the reset email. I checked my spam folder as well.\n\nThis is urgent as I need to pay some bills this week. Can you please help me regain access to my account?\n\nThank you,\nLisa Thompson\nPhone: (555) 222-3333",
